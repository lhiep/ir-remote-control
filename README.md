# IR REMOTE CONTROL
A simple remote control can be constructed with an Arduino of any type (Uno, Mega, Nano, etc...), an IR LED, and a couple buttons. The source code in this repository is designed to use the Sony Protocol for IR remote control. Other protocols can be used by modifying the code file correspondingly.
